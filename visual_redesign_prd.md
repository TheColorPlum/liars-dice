# Liar's Dice Visual Redesign - Mini PRD
## "Degenerate Gambling Between Friends" Theme

### Project Overview
**Vision**: Create a fun, engaging interface that captures the authentic feeling of "degenerate gambling between friends" - where people get tilted, super into quick games, with consistent 2D pixel art aesthetic.

**Core Principles**:
- Everything is on the table for redesign - zero-based approach
- Layout first, window dressing second
- Screen-by-screen implementation with distinct user stories
- Consistent 2D pixel art visual style
- Games should feel quick and intense, not dragged out

**Reference Materials**:
- Game Table Mockup: `/Users/plum/Downloads/ChatGPT Image Jul 11, 2025, 11_31_21 AM.png`
- Main Menu Mockup: `/Users/plum/Downloads/ChatGPT Image Jul 11, 2025, 11_35_22 AM.png`

## 1. Theme & Tone Definition

### 1.1 Emotional Target
**The "Tilted Friends" Experience**:
- Quick escalation from casual to intense
- Clear visual hierarchy for fast decision-making under pressure
- Satisfying tactile feedback (button presses, dice rolls)
- Visual cues that amplify the social dynamics and psychological gameplay
- Interface that gets out of the way when tension is high

### 1.2 Visual Personality
**Authentic Pixel Casino Aesthetic**:
- Clean, readable pixel art (not cluttered retro-for-retro's-sake)
- Casino felt green as primary background color
- Warm gold/yellow accents for important actions
- Red for challenge/danger states
- Simple, bold typography that works at small sizes
- Consistent spacing and alignment (snap to pixel grid)

### 1.3 Interaction Principles
**Fast & Satisfying**:
- Immediate visual feedback on all interactions
- Touch targets optimized for mobile (minimum 44px)
- Clear affordances - buttons look clickable
- Animation that enhances rather than delays gameplay
- Progressive disclosure - show what's needed when it's needed

## 2. Asset Analysis & Requirements

### 2.1 Current Asset Inventory
**Available Assets**:
- ‚úÖ Dice sprites: `dice_X_Y.png` (6 colors √ó 7 states including mystery)
- ‚úÖ Button states: 8 color variants with normal/hover/clicked states
- ‚úÖ Background panels: Black/white and color variants
- ‚úÖ Border elements: 5 variations with/without backgrounds

**Asset Quality Concerns**:
- üîç **Need to verify**: Proper scaling across different screen densities
- üîç **Need to test**: Background removal requirements for borders
- üîç **Need to check**: Consistent pixel density across all assets
- üîç **Missing**: Felt texture background for game table

### 2.2 Asset Gap Analysis (Based on Mockups)
**Missing Assets**:
- üìã **Felt Background Texture**: Game table needs authentic casino felt
- üìã **Card Panel Backgrounds**: Player/opponent card containers
- üìã **Progress Bar Elements**: For "Aggressiveness" indicator
- üìã **Pixel Font Files**: Authentic pixel typography (currently using system monospace)
- üìã **Number Display Panels**: Dice count, bid values
- üìã **Menu Background**: Main menu backdrop texture

**Format Requirements**:
- All assets need transparency support (PNG)
- Consistent pixel scale (verify 1x, 2x, 3x scaling)
- Border assets may need background removal for layering
- Color palette standardization across all assets

- Background texture system
- Typography component with pixel font
- Layout container with proper spacing

**Success Criteria**:
- Buttons feel immediately clickable and satisfying
- Clear reading hierarchy even at mobile sizes

### 3.2 Phase 2: Game Table (Core Experience)
**User Story**: *"As a tilted player in a tense game, I need crystal clear information hierarchy to make quick decisions"*

**Current State**: Basic layout with standard components
**Target State**: Authentic casino table feel matching mockup

- **Top**: Opponent cards in horizontal row
- **Bottom**: Player dice and information 
- **Center-Right**: Bidding interface with current bid
- **Bottom-Right**: Aggressiveness indicator (new feature)
- **Left**: Action buttons (Bid/Challenge)

**Components Needed**:
- Redesigned PlayerCard (both self and opponent views)
- BiddingInterface with clear current bid display
- NEW: AggressivenessIndicator component
- Enhanced DiceDisplay with pixel art dice
- Action button grouping

**Emotional Design Requirements**:
- Opponent cards feel slightly intimidating/mysterious
- Player area feels like "your space"
- Bidding area draws focus during decision time
- Aggressiveness meter adds psychological pressure
- Visual feedback escalates tension appropriately

### 3.3 Phase 3: Supporting Screens
**Single Player Setup**: Quick AI difficulty and player count selection
**Game History**: Clean log of recent actions with visual hierarchy
**Settings**: Minimal options, focus on audio/visual preferences
**Challenge Results**: Dramatic reveal of dice with clear win/lose states

## 4. Component Design System (Zero-Based)

### 4.1 Foundation Components

#### PixelButton v2.0
**Purpose**: All interactive buttons throughout the app
**Variants**: 
- Primary (gold/yellow) - main actions
- Secondary (green) - neutral actions  
- Danger (red) - challenge/risky actions
- Disabled (gray) - unavailable actions

**States**: Normal ‚Üí Hover ‚Üí Pressed ‚Üí Disabled
**Requirements**: 
- Minimum 44px touch target
- Clear visual feedback on state changes
- Pixel-perfect sprite rendering

#### PixelCard v2.0
**Purpose**: Player information containers (self + opponents)
**Variants**:
- Player card (bottom, expanded info)
- Opponent card (top, condensed info)
- Empty seat (placeholder state)

**Content Hierarchy**:
1. Player name/avatar
2. Dice count (prominent)
3. Status indicators (active turn, eliminated, etc.)

- H1: Game state announcements ("Your Turn", "Challenge!", etc.)
- H2: Player names, current bid
- Body: General information text
- Numbers: Dice counts, bid values (high contrast, bold)

### 4.3 Color Palette (Refined from Mockups)
```typescript
// Based on mockup analysis - more muted than current theme
const VisualTheme = {
  // Primary casino felt green (from mockup)
  background: '#1a5a1a',  // Darker, more authentic felt
  
  // Gold accents (from mockup buttons)
  primary: '#d4af37',     // More muted gold
  primaryDark: '#b8941f',
  
  // Challenge/danger red
  danger: '#c41e3a',
  dangerDark: '#9a1529',
  
  // Text colors
  textLight: '#f5f5dc',   // Cream/beige for readability

## 5. Implementation Strategy

### 5.1 Layout-First Approach (As Requested)
**Phase A: Structure & Spacing**
1. Create wireframe layouts without styling
2. Establish component hierarchy and spacing
3. Implement responsive behavior for different screen sizes
4. Test information architecture and user flow

**Phase B: Visual Design Application**  
1. Apply pixel art assets and color scheme
2. Implement typography and iconography
3. Add border and background elements
4. Refine visual hierarchy with contrast and color

**Phase C: Polish & Animation**
1. Add satisfying micro-interactions
2. Implement state transition animations  
3. Add "game juice" effects (screen shake, particles, etc.)
4. Performance optimization and testing

### 5.2 Technical Implementation Notes
**Asset Management**:
- Create centralized AssetManager for pixel art loading
- Implement consistent scaling across screen densities
- Optimize for React Native performance (avoid image resizing)
- Fallback handling for asset loading failures

**Component Architecture**:
