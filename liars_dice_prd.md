### 5.3 AI Implementation Reference

The computer AI system should implement a sophisticated confidence-based approach for decision making, based on the following reference from the previous version:

```typescript
// Core AI decision types
interface AIMove {
  shouldChallenge: boolean;
  bid?: Bid;
}

// AI difficulty configuration
interface AIDifficulty {
  challengeThreshold: number;    // Confidence level to challenge
  bidAcceptanceThreshold: number; // Confidence level to accept making bid
  probabilityMultiplier: number;  // Adjustment to probability calculations
}

const AI_DIFFICULTIES: Record<string, AIDifficulty> = {
  easy: {
    challengeThreshold: -0.25,      // More conservative challenging
    bidAcceptanceThreshold: -0.05,  // More conservative bidding
    probabilityMultiplier: 0.9      // Slightly pessimistic estimates
  },
  medium: {
    challengeThreshold: -0.35,      // Baseline from implementation
    bidAcceptanceThreshold: -0.15,  // Baseline from implementation
    probabilityMultiplier: 1.0      // Standard probability (33% per die)
  },
  hard: {
    challengeThreshold: -0.45,      // More aggressive challenging
    bidAcceptanceThreshold: -0.25,  // More aggressive bidding
    probabilityMultiplier: 1.1      // Slightly optimistic estimates
  }
};

// Key AI functions (to be implemented based on reference)
generateComputerMove(player, players, currentBid, isEndGame): AIMove
calculateBidConfidence(bid, ownDice, totalDice, ownDiceCount): number
calculateBidProbability(bid, ownDice, totalDice): number
generateEndGameMove(player, currentBid): AIMove
generateNormalGameMove(player, players, currentBid): AIMove
```

**AI Decision Flow:**
1. **Endgame Detection**: Special logic for 1v1 with single dice
2. **Confidence Calculation**: Evaluate current bid against known dice
3. **Challenge Decision**: Challenge if confidence below threshold
4. **Bid Generation**: Find best valid bid within confidence range
5. **Fallback Strategy**: Challenge if no confident bids available

**Integration Points:**
- `game_states.ai_moves` - Log AI decisions for analysis
- `matches.ai_difficulty` - Store difficulty setting per match
- Real-time AI move delays for natural pacing

```javascript
// Supabase real-time channels
const gameChannels = {
  match: `match:${matchId}`,           // Match-level updates
  lobby: `lobby:${roomCode}`,          // Lobby/waiting room
  leaderboard: 'leaderboard:global'    // Global leaderboard updates
};
```
